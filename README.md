### Advent of Code Solutions

Solutions to Advent of Code problems over the years.

I intend to work on finishing up the unsolved ones and polishing up the existing ones over the course of 2021. So the tag ***prehistory*** will mark where things stood at the beginning of December 2020.

For the easily amused, here's my track record as of 1 December, 2021:

Year | Stars | Missing Problems | Notes
:----|:-----:|:-----------------|:-----
2015 | 9     | 5b-              | And I was going to do *every* day in Forth and Lua...
2016 | 4     | 3a-              |
2017 | 44    | 18b, 20b, 21ab, 23b, 25b |
2018 | 35    | 13b, 15ab, 17ab, 19b, 20a-21b, 22b, 23b, 24ab, 25b | First year in Go.
2019 | 1     | 1b- | Bad year. I can't find the code for 1a, but I have the star, so I must have done it.
2020 | 44    | 19ab, 20ab, 25ab                | 
2021 | in progress... || Started out with Go again. I had intended to switch to a new language, but was lazy. I still might switch...
